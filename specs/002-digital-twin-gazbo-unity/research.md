# Research: Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

This module's scope and content are well-defined by the feature specification and project constitution. No specific external research beyond the existing project context is deemed necessary for the planning phase. The module will synthesize existing knowledge about digital twins, Gazebo, Unity, and sensor simulation into an accessible format.
