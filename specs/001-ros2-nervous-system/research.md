# Research: Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This module's scope and content are well-defined by the feature specification and project constitution. No specific external research beyond the existing project context is deemed necessary for the planning phase. The module will synthesize existing knowledge about ROS 2, rclpy, and URDF into an accessible format.
