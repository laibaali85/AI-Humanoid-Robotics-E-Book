### User Story 4 - Learn Nav2 for Humanoid Locomotion (Priority: P2)

As a student, I want to learn about Nav2's role in high-level locomotion planning for humanoid robots, so that I can understand how these complex robots achieve autonomous movement.

**Why this priority**: Nav2 is a standard navigation framework, adapted for complex platforms like humanoids.

**Independent Test**: A student can explain how Nav2 helps a humanoid robot plan its movements in an environment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a humanoid robot needing to navigate across a room to a specific point, **When** asked about the planning software involved, **Then** the student mentions Nav2.
2.  **Given** the challenges of humanoid locomotion, **When** asked about Nav2's contribution, **Then** the student highlights its path planning and obstacle avoidance capabilities.
