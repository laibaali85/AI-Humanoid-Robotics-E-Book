# Research: Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

This module's scope and content are well-defined by the feature specification and project constitution. No specific external research beyond the existing project context is deemed necessary for the planning phase. The module will synthesize existing knowledge about NVIDIA Isaac platforms, including Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2, into an accessible format.
