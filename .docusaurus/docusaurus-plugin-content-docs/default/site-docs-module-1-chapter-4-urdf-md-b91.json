  "title": "Chapter 4: Describing Robots with URDF",
  "description": "The Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) is an XML file format that allows you to describe all elements of a robot. This includes its physical properties (like mass and inertia), visual characteristics (how it looks), and most importantly, its kinematic and dynamic structure (how its parts move relative to each other). This chapter will introduce the basic concepts of URDF, focusing on links (the rigid parts of a robot) and joints (how those parts connect and move).",
