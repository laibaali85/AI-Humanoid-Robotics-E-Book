## Prompt

fix sidebar configuration for docasauras and add my modules and chapters according to docasaraus

## Response snapshot

I have updated the sidebars.ts file to manually create the sidebar based on your modules and chapters.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The sidebar is now correctly configured to show the modules and chapters.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: sidebars.ts was modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: null
- 🧠 Reflection: The autogenerated sidebar was not sufficient for the user's needs. A manual sidebar was created to provide the desired structure.
