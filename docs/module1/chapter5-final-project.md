## Project Overview

Welcome to the final project for Module 1: ROS2 Nervous System! This hands-on project will integrate all the core concepts you've learned throughout this module. You will be building a complete robotics application using ROS 2, focusing on communication primitives, package creation, and hardware interaction. This project aims to solidify your understanding and provide practical experience in developing with ROS 2.

## Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

1.  **Create and manage ROS 2 packages:** Develop a structured ROS 2 workspace and create custom packages for your project.
2.  **Define and use custom messages/services/actions:** Implement custom interfaces to enable complex communication between nodes.
3.  **Implement ROS 2 nodes for various functionalities:** Design and code individual nodes responsible for specific tasks within the robotics application.
4.  **Integrate hardware (simulated or real):** Interface with a simulated robot or a physical platform (e.g., TurtleBot 3) to demonstrate your application.
5.  **Troubleshoot and debug ROS 2 applications:** Apply debugging techniques to identify and resolve issues in your robotics project.

## Key Components

This project will involve the following key components:

-   **ROS 2 Workspace:** Your development environment for the project.
-   **Custom ROS 2 Package:** A dedicated package for your final project's nodes and configurations.
-   **Publishers and Subscribers:** Nodes that send and receive data streams (e.g., sensor data, command velocity).
-   **Services and Clients:** Nodes that provide request-response communication for specific tasks (e.g., triggering an action).
-   **Actions:** Nodes that handle long-running tasks with feedback and cancellation capabilities.
-   **URDF Model:** (Optional, if using a custom simulated robot) A Unified Robot Description Format model to define your robot's structure.
-   **Simulation Environment:** (e.g., Gazebo, if using simulation) An environment to test your robot without physical hardware.

## Expected Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this project, you will have:

-   A fully functional ROS 2 robotics application demonstrating inter-node communication.
-   A well-structured ROS 2 package following best practices.
-   Practical experience in designing and implementing complex ROS 2 systems.
-   A deeper understanding of how to apply theoretical ROS 2 concepts to real-world problems.

Let's get started and build something amazing!
