# Chapter 2: ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services

This chapter dives into the core communication mechanisms within ROS 2. We will learn about nodes, which are the fundamental computational units, and how they communicate using topics for streaming data and services for request-response interactions. Understanding these primitives is key to building complex robot behaviors.
