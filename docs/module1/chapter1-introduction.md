# Chapter 1: Introduction to ROS 2 (Understanding the Nervous System)

This chapter introduces ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) as the fundamental communication and coordination framework for robots. We'll explore why it's often called the "nervous system" of a robot, enabling different components to send and receive information, much like biological systems.

ROS 2 provides a structured way for various software components (nodes) to interact, allowing for modular development and reuse of code across different robotic platforms. This foundational understanding is crucial for anyone looking to connect AI with physical robot bodies.
